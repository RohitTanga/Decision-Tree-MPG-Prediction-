# Auto MPG Prediction

This Python script predicts a car's miles per gallon (MPG) using a Decision Tree Regressor and the Auto MPG dataset. It also provides visualizations.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`.
2. Download the Auto MPG dataset (CSV) and specify its path in the code.
3. Run the script to train the model and visualize the results.

## Key Visualizations

- A scatter plot shows actual vs. predicted MPG.
- A Decision Tree visualization is included.

Feel free to adapt and extend this code for your own projects.
